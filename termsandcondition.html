                          </h1>
                          <p>Notwithstanding the generality or effect of other provisions of this Terms and Conditions of Use, you agree to indemnify, hold harmless, and defend QuickMed and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, affiliates, agents and employees, parent companies, (collectively, “Indemnified Parties” and each, individually, an “Indemnified Party”) against all costs, expenses, liabilities and damages (including reasonable attorney’s fees) incurred by any Indemnified Party in connection with any third party claims arising out of: (i) your use of the Platform or any part of it; (ii) your failure to comply with any applicable laws and regulations; and (iii) your breach of any obligations set forth in this Terms and Conditions of Use. 
                            This indemnity obligation shall survive this Terms and Conditions of Use and your use of the Platform. QuickMed reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will assist and cooperate with QuickMed in asserting any available defenses.
                            </p>

                          <p>Notwithstanding any provision hereunder, neither QuickMed nor its third-party partners shall be liable for any delay in or failure to perform its obligations under this Terms and Conditions of Use where such delay is caused by circumstances beyond its reasonable control. 
                            Force majeure here means the occurrence of an extraordinary event or circumstance beyond the control of both parties, including but not limited to wars, sabotage, acts of terror, system breakdown, network failures, strikes, riots, crimes, epidemics, Labour disputes, flood, fires, legislative enactments or government policies or events described as an act of God (such as, flooding, earthquake, volcanic eruption, etc.) And which we could not have reasonably foreseen or guarded against and which by exercise of reasonable care and diligence, we are unable to prevent.

                          <p>This Terms and Conditions of Use and all disputes and matters arising from the Platform (or its use) shall be governed by the laws of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.
                            In the event of a controversy, claim or dispute arising out of or relating to this Terms and Conditions of Use, the Parties shall attempt in good faith to resolve such controversy, claim or dispute promptly by negotiation between the parties or their authorized representatives. If parties are unable to resolve the controversy, claim or dispute, the parties shall be at liberty to explore any other dispute resolution mechanism known to Law including mediation, arbitration or litigation.

                            </h1>
                            <p>Entire Agreement: This Terms and Conditions of Use constitutes the sole agreement between you and QuickMed for your use and the provision of the Services and the subject matter hereof, and no representations, statements or inducements, oral or written, not contained in this Terms and Conditions of Use shall bind either you or QuickMed.
                              Severance: If any provision of this Terms and Conditions of Use is prohibited by law or judged by a court to be unlawful, void or unenforceable, the provision shall, to the extent required, be severed from this Terms and Conditions of Use and rendered ineffective as far as possible without modifying the remaining provisions of this Terms and Conditions of Use, and shall not in any way affect any other circumstances of or the validity or enforcement of this Terms and Conditions of Use.
                              Waiver: Failure to insist on performance of any of the terms of this Terms and Conditions of Use will not operate as a waiver of any subsequent default. No waiver by QuickMed of any right under this Terms and Conditions of Use will be deemed to be either a waiver of any other right or provision or a waiver of that same right or provision at any other time.
                              Assignment: You hereby agree that we may assign, transfer, sub-contract or otherwise deal with our rights and/or obligations under this Terms and Conditions of Use. 
                              Bindingness: This Terms and Conditions of Use shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of each of the parties and the parties’ respective successors and permitted assigns.
